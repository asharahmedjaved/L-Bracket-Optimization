# L Bracket Optimization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing the **L Bracket** using computational design techniques and genetic algorithms. The goal is to enhance the structural integrity while minimizing material usage and weight.

## Objectives
- Design an initial L Bracket model in **SolidWorks**.
- Perform structural analysis using **ANSYS**.
- Implement a **genetic algorithm (GA)** to optimize the bracket's shape and material distribution.
- Validate the optimized design against initial stress, weight, and performance criteria.

## Technologies Used
- **SolidWorks**: 3D modeling and parametric design.
- **ANSYS**: Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for stress testing.
- **Python**: Automation and optimization using Genetic Algorithms.
- **MATLAB**: Additional numerical analysis and verification.

## Features
- Parametric L Bracket design with adjustable constraints.
- Automated FEA for evaluating stress and deformation.
- Genetic Algorithm implementation for iterative optimization.
- Result visualization and performance comparison.
