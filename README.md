# L-Bracket-Optimization
----
It is a personal project to create an L bracket within given constraints and optimize it using genetic algorithm. 

I will employ automation techniques in SOLIDWORKS to create parts and analyze data enough to feed into genetic algorith.

Currently it is in early stages, but lets go!
